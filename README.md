# Arch-Installation
## Disclaimer
Script of commands for mostly unattended Installation of Arch Linux, hopefully all the way to installation of KDE Plasma, my primary desktop atm.

I kinda want to go in a similar way to the ArchTitus-Scripts where you call certain scripts as steps through one Masterscript as needed. Like that one doesnt need to scim through the entire script to make changes as needed but can pull up specificparts or even disable them entirely



Rather than just lazily forking someone else i want to use this project as a means to get more proficient with bashfile-scripting so this will be from 0 with all the potential hassle included.

The following planned steps are as of now probably incomplete and will likely change over the course of the project and are in no particular order - Tips and ideas are always welcome :)
